# Contributing to Uniswap Interface

👋 Thanks for your interest in contributing to Uniswap!  
This repository is the **public mirror** of Uniswap Labs' front-end interfaces, including the web app, wallet mobile app, and wallet browser extension.

## Development Workflow

Uniswap Labs maintains and develops all interfaces in a **private repository**. At the end of each development cycle:

1. A **production release** is created internally.
2. The release is then **published to this public repository**.
3. All releases are tagged and visible in the [Releases](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/releases) tab.

Because of this private development model:

**We do not accept pull requests to this repository.**

## How You *Can* Contribute
